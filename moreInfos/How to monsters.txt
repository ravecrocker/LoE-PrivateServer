=> We need to design the monsters / mobs.

=> First, the file format
=> We're going to have zones where mobs spawn.
=> We could have one folder/scene ?
=> Not really important, we're going to load everything at startup and keep it in RAM from there on.
==> If the server resets, we don't really care if the mobs reset too.
=> Okay, so one file/zone, everything in the same folder. Filenames are meaningful to the user, not the server.
=> A mobzone is a square in 3D space where the mobs will spawn. You can have any number of mobs/mobzone.
=> "in 3D space" means it doesn't need to be an horizontal plane. 
=> But not doing so might be asking for trouble due to possible AI limitations.
=> We need two 3D coordinates to define a mobzone's bounds. So that's 6 floats.
=> We'll use plaintext. Since we only touch those files at startup and there aren't many of them, we can afford it.
=> Plus, I'm not making a mobzone editor, plaintext is convenient.
=> Shouldn't be as high level as a questscript, but slightly more highlevel than a vortex since server owners will want to edit them
=> We'll still want lines starting with # to be comments. We can afford it.
=> Okay, so a mobzone will have one statement/line. It must have a pair of startPos and endPos statements.
=> They don't have to be unique, but we'll only remember the last statement's result to simplify the parser's code
=> startPos and endPos define the bounds of the mobzone. E.g "startPos 12.431 -3.147 121.08"
=> The coordinates can be found with server command getPos
=> So, we'll have a "mob" statement.
=> As a readability/parser-simplicity compromise, the mob line will look like bochrc's cpuid, with pairs of key=value, key2=value2
=> The first arg will be the type of mob, "mobName". E.g "mobName=Mobs/Timberwolf". Mandatory.
=> Next we'll need the agressiveness as an option. 
=> The radius of a mob's aggro zone, and the odds of the mob attacking you when you enter its aggro zone
=> Default value should be to never deal the first blow. So odds of 0% and a reasonable radius (not 0, or he'll never fight back)
=> So we'll have e.g "aggrRadius=200" and "aggrOdds=50%". We'll just replace('%',"").
=> Next we'll need the mob's minimum respawn interval. How much time between you kill a mob and he rewpawns
=> We'll want to add a random part to the respawn interval, to make it more interesting.
=> So we'll have e.g "respawnMinTime=15, respawnMaxTime=20" in seconds
=> Finally we'll want to be able to set a reward. If we ever get dungeons and bosses, or quests with special mobs, or whatever. As an option.
=> "rewardBits=10, rewardItems=10 15 25 61"
=> Default value is of course 0 bits and no items.
=> We'll also want a param for the cooldown between attacks. So we can have mobs that are gattling-gun-tier or slowpokes.
=> And we need a hate cooldown for forgetting that someone attacked us and we hate him.
=> We need an idle cooldown. How long before we forget we're trying to kill ponies and go back to idling.

=> Next the AI. Dammit. The AI.
=> I have no idea how it works ATM so this is not a definitive reference.
=> Worst case the client's interface is just changing the 3D pos / rot / animation / stats of a mob
=> And that's probably the case.
=> So we don't have the maps loaded server side. We don't know where the damn floor is. Fun ensues.
=> Unless mobs can into gravity (npcs can't so I don't have much hopes), we're going to stay inside the mobzone at all costs.
=> We can only walk on the square defined by the mobzone. Yes it's shit, any idea that doesn't involve writing a game engine & parsing the maps ?
==> Waypoints ? Nope, it needs to be able to go anywhere in the zone, to follow the player and rekt his shit.
==> Or we could define empty mobzones and allow mobs to switch to a different mobzone when they are aggressing a player.
===> Dammit this could actually work. We'd have squares you can walk on, a bad approximation of the map, but good enough.
===> We'd need a path finder algo. A way to tell what mobzone a player is in, and wether or not the mob can go in this mobzone
===> So, we'd have three "modes" of movement. 
===> If we're idle and in our spawn zone, we move not too far at random in the zone from time to time.
===> If we're idle, but not in our spawn zone, we try to go back to the spawn zone.
===> If we're attacking a player and the player is in the zone we're in, we try to get closer to him while staying inside this zone
===> If we're attacking a player and he's in another zone, we try to find a path to this other zone and rekt his asset
===> If a player is too high above us or gets out of our aggro radius, we switch back to idle, but we don't forget that we hate him
===> If he gets in our aggro zone again and he attacked us before, we now have a 100% aggro odds.
==> The mob always knows what zone he's in. The player's doesn't have to remember if he's in a mobzone, the AI will compute it on the fly.
==> A player is in a mobzone if he's "in the square regardless of his height". If he's in the pillar defined by extruding the mobzone vertically.
==> If two mobzones overlap (they need to if we want a mob to be able to cross), the player is in the mobzone closest to the one of the mob.
==> Remember that the player's mobzone is only used when a mob tries to do pathfinding, and we want to avoid changing zones as much as possible
==> So if we have the choice, the player is always in the closest mobzone when it overlaps. 
==> This way the AI isn't trying to change zone and walk around when it should really just be attacking.
=> Okay, so we need to remember wich players we hate. By default we don't hate anyone, as soon as we aggro or get attacked, we add someone to the list
=> If someone we hate doesn't get back in our current mobzone before the hate cooldown, we forget that we hate him
=> If we don't have anyone we hate in our current mobzone, we switch to idle mode after the idle cooldown.
=> If we have only one person we hate in our mobzone and we're not idle, we go attack him. If we're idle we wait until he comes in our aggro zone.
=> If we have multiple persons we hate and we're not idle, attack the closest. If we're idle wait until they come in the aggro zone.
=> We don't attack someone if he's higher than our max attack height. We attack someone else if possible, or we follow him if not idle.
=> Dragons or cockatrices can attack someone even if he's high, lantern monsters can't.
