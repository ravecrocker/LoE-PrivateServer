=> Since I'm a faggot, I'll make my own NPC script and interpreter :
==> Filenames should be XXName where XX is id of the quest. Not mandatory.
==> Have a quest struct wich remembers qstringlist of commands, quest id/name/descr/state and EIP
==> EIP should be reset everytime you start a new conversation with a NPC. Don't resume from the last time.
=> Lines starting with # are comments. No midline comments tho.

Each player has a copy of the Quest class.
An answer should always be following a say or another answer.
When reaching a say, we send the say and all the answers under it, then wait until the client answers.
If a say has no answers, we still send it and wait until the client clicks to continue.
